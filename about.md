Hi! I'm currently an engineering student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a double major in mechanical and robotics engineering.
I've been passionate about creating and tinkering from a young age and in my free time (hard to believe I have some of that...) I enjoy 
working on projects. I've participated in FIRST robotics in high school and am continuing my studies in this multi-disciplinary field in 
my curriculum as well as the combat robotics club at WPI. I made this site to serve as a way to document my journey along all of my different personal projects.
