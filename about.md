Hi! I'm currently an engineering student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a double major in mechanical and robotics engineering. [Showcase of some school projects here!]({% link school-projects.md %})

I've been passionate about creating and tinkering from a young age and in my free time I enjoy working on projects that stimulate learning and exercise my broad range of skills. I've participated in FIRST robotics in high school and am continuing my studies in this multi-disciplinary field in my curriculum as well as the combat robotics club at WPI. I made this site to serve as a way to document my journey along all of my different personal projects and provide a portfolio of my many skills.

One of my skillsets that have evolved from my hobbies is additive manufacturing. I purchased a 3D printer almost three years ago after a month of research and it has been one of my most valuable investments. While there is not a *ton* of tangible things to show for this, I have put in hundreds of hours learning, troubleshooting, and experimenting with the ins-and-outs of my printer and other printers. With that, I am well experienced in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing and a huge proponent of iterative design. I would love to learn more on more advanced methodologies, like SLS, SLA, or DMLS.

Some of my other skills include: 
- Computer and microprocessor programming (Java, C, C++, Arduino, Python, Javascript)
- Computer-aided design (CAD) with Autodesk Inventor and Solidworks
- Basic soldering and wiring
- Workshop tools and equipment
- Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining
