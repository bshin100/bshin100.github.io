Hi! I'm currently an engineering student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a double major in mechanical and robotics engineering. While this site was primarily created to showcase and document my personal projects and skills, I felt that it would only be appropriate that I also highlight some of the work that I've accomplished in my project-based college curriculum.

Here is a quick list at a glance.

**Contents:**
