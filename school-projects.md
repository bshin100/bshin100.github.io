Hi! I'm currently an engineering student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a double major in mechanical and robotics engineering. While this site was primarily created to showcase and document my personal projects and skills, I felt that it would only be appropriate that I also highlight some of the work that I've accomplished in my project-based college curriculum.

Here is a quick list at a glance. For reference, these are all final projects. "RBE" stands for robotics engineering classes, and "CS" are computer science classes. 

**Contents:**
- [Autonomous Roofing Robot (RBE 2001)]({% link school/RBE2001.md %})
- [Autonomous Parkour Robot (RBE 2002)]({% link school/RBE2002.md %})
- [Autonomous Robotic Ball-Sorter (RBE 3001)]({% link school/RBE3001.md %})
- [Autonomous Pathfinding Robot (RBE 3002)]({% link school/RBE3002.md %})
- [Full-Stack Hospital Management Application (CS 3733)]({% link school/CS3733.md %})
- More to come!
