I"Š<p>Hi! Iâ€™m currently an engineering student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a double major in mechanical and robotics engineering. While this site was primarily created to showcase and document my personal projects and skills, I felt that it would only be appropriate that I also highlight some of the work that Iâ€™ve accomplished in my project-based college curriculum.</p>
