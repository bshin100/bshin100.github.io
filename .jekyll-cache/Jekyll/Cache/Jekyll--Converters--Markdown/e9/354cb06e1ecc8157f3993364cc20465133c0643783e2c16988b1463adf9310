I"ƒ<p>Hi! Iâ€™m currently an engineering student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a double major in mechanical and robotics engineering. <a href="/school-projects/">Showcase of some school projects here!</a></p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been passionate about creating and tinkering from a young age and in my free time I enjoy working on projects that stimulate learning and exercise my broad range of skills. Iâ€™ve participated in FIRST robotics in high school and am continuing my studies in this multi-disciplinary field in my curriculum as well as the combat robotics club at WPI. I made this site to serve as a way to document my journey along all of my different personal projects and provide a portfolio of my many skills.</p>

<p>One of my skillsets that have evolved from my hobbies is additive manufacturing. I purchased a 3D printer almost three years ago after a month of research and it has been one of my most valuable investments. While there is not a <em>ton</em> of tangible things to show for this, I have put in hundreds of hours learning, troubleshooting, and experimenting with the ins-and-outs of my printer and other printers. With that, I am well experienced in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing and a huge proponent of iterative design. I would love to learn more on more advanced methodologies, like SLS, SLA, or DMLS.</p>

<p>Some of my other skills include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Computer and microprocessor programming (Java, C, C++, Arduino, Python, Javascript, MATLAB, ROS)
    <ul>
      <li>Embedded programming</li>
      <li>Full-stack application development</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Computer-aided design (CAD) with Autodesk Inventor and Solidworks</li>
  <li>Basic soldering and wiring</li>
  <li>Workshop tools and equipment</li>
  <li>Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining</li>
</ul>
