title: Beetleweight Combat Robot
---

> Custom engineered and fabricated combat robot constrained under 3lbs.

### Time frame: November, 2019 - Present

Ever seen BattleBots the TV show before? If not, it's essentially lots of 250-lb remote-operated robots that destructively battle in a contained box with high-power spinners, drums, or flippers. It's hard to describe in text, so I would recommend looking up a [quick clip online.](https://youtu.be/diOJz6U6MEA?t=26) The power stored in these weapons are unfathomable. These cost upwards of a luxury vehicle and more.

This project is similar to those robots but on a much smaller (and cheaper) scale. I decided to do this under the guidance and funding of the combat robotics club at WPI. 

The initial design was completed in November, 2019, and parts were purchased shortly after. Unfortunately, given the timeline of a busy semester and then a global pandemic, not much of this project has yet to come to fruition. More on this soon!

Here is the current design of the robot:

The aluminum front panel milled:

**Total Cost:** roughly $500, so far.
