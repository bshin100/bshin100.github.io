title: Electric Longboard

> TL;DR: A DIY electric longboard with 3200+ Watts of power capable of about 15 miles range and 32+ mph speed.

Timeframe: August 2019

Seeing videos of people riding both commerical and DIY electric longboards and efficiently traveling small distances (like on a college campus), I was inspired to create my own electric longboard. While I had minimal normal longboarding (or skating) experience, I thought this would be a fun project to challenge myself and stimulate my passion for creation. After doing about a month of research on commercial boards and off-the-shelf components, I decided to pull the trigger on a DIY one.

The basic components of an electric longboard are: the longboard deck, trucks, wheels, motors, motor mounts, battery, and an electronic speed controller (ESC). There also is a handful of hardware components as well.

There was a lot of decisions to make in terms of the choice of components for power (pretty much how fast it would go and how much torque), power transmission, battery size and more. Careful research brought me to a cost-effective DIY setup involving belt-driven wheels (as opposed to hub motors which live within the wheels) and a 12s (50.4 Volts) Li-Ion Battery capable of about 15 miles of range. While a "DIY" board can have everything purchased from the basic components, enclosures, and so on, I wanted to actually make something and not just assemble hardware. With this, I decided to custom fabricate the enclosures that house the battery and other electronics.
