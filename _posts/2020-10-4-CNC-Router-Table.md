> Precision computer-controlled router capable of milling wood, plastic, & aluminum.

Time frame: June, 2020 - Present (On Hold)

After a few years' experience with a commercial CNC router in my high school robotics shop (a Laguna for those know!), and some more with the vast array of CNC mills at my university, I decided to challenge myself in building a precise and cost-effective CNC router during quarantine 2020.

I am following the open-source platform from V1 Engineering - [the Mostly Printed CNC (MPCNC)](https://www.v1engineering.com/specifications/)
I decided on a build volume of 24" x 18" x 3" which is comparatively small to the 4' x 8' capability of my high school robotics machine, however definitely not needed for the parts I intend to mill. Having a small build volume is important for this design as it utilizes 3D printed components and mild-steel tubing as rails as a machine too large will encounter more vibration, inaccuracy, and begin to meet the rigidity limits of the tubing. As detailed on the V1 Engineering website, using EMT conduit - normally used for routing electrical wiring in houses and buildings - keeps the costs low, as opposed to the traditional linear rails on a professional machine.

I purchased the components individually (self-sourced, not from the kit) earlier in June and began 3D printing the parts. The dimensional accuracy and structural integrity of these printed parts are pretty important to having a precise machine. I encountered some difficulty with under-extrusion on my 3D printer, which was frustrating since I had about a year of problem-free printing prior to this project. I managed to get all of the parts printed in PLA, using a little over 1.5 kg.

Total Cost: $600+ so far.
